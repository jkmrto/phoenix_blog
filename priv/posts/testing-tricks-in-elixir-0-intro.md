Lately I have been double thinking about some practices and strategies that I follow when creating tests in Elixir. I thougt it would be a good idea to write about it, in a series of quick posts.

In this first post, Iâ€™ll introduce some fundamental testing principles before diving into specific techniques and tricks that are particularly useful in Elixir.

## The importance of tests 

Automated testing serves as a robust defense against bugs seeping into the production environment, especially in projects with a long lifespan. As a project grows and accumulates contributors, coupled with ongoing refactors, maintaining stability becomes a challenge.

Ensuring the project's extensibility while preserving stability is particularly crucial. Well-designed tests act as a guarantee that a feature developed today will have the same behavior even after subsequent refactors or the addition of new features.
 
## Key Characteristics of Effective Tests

In order to guarantee the effectivity and the maintenability of a test suite in the long term, it is valuable to define some characteristics that each test should have. One of the last book I read, [Software Engineering at Google](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/48816586), provides some great insights about them:

- **Completeness**: A test is complete when the body contains all the information a reader needs to understand how it arrives to the result.
- **Conciseness**: A test should avoid contaning any superflous information that it is irrelevant or even distracting. The less code surface we have in a test, the less probable is that it may be affected by a change in other part of the codebase. 
- **Test State not Behaviours**: Distinguishing between state testing and behavior testing is crucial. State testing evaluates changes a function has made, while behavior testing scrutinizes interactions with other components. Preferably, lean towards state changes to avoid unnecessary dependencies. 

The ultimate goal of these characteristics is to avoid brittle tests. Brittle tests are prone to failure due to unrelated changes, leading to a frustrating developer experience. 

Fom a test suite perspective we want to have an stable test suite that run as fast as possible, if we explore this idea other characteristics to look for:

- **Quick execution time** The quicker a test suite is, the quicker a developer will get feedback from it. Reducing the time of the feedback loop will increase the productivity in the long term. Other benefit is that we will reduce the consumption of resources in the CI, that may affects some bills.
- **Deterministic**. A test is deterministic if running it several times always generates the same outcome. This may look simple but there are some cases that needs an extra effort like when working with dates or when having to handle possible race conditions in asynchronus processes.
